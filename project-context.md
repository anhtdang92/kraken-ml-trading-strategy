### Cloud Architecture (GCP)

- **Cloud Run**: Hosts Streamlit application (containerized)
- **Vertex AI**: Trains LSTM models on schedule
- **BigQuery**: Stores historical data, trading logs, model metrics
- **Cloud Storage**: Stores trained models and backups
- **Cloud Scheduler**: Triggers weekly rebalancing function
- **Cloud Functions**: Executes automated trading logic
- **Secret Manager**: Securely stores Kraken API credentials

## 🎯 Core Features & Design Decisions

### 1. Data Collection Strategy

**Decision**: Use Kraken API as primary data source, CoinAPI as backup

**Rationale**:
- Kraken API is free and provides OHLCV data
- Direct integration with trading platform ensures data consistency
- CoinAPI can fill historical gaps if needed

**Implementation**:
- Fetch daily OHLCV data for 4-12 cryptocurrencies
- Store in BigQuery partitioned by date for cost efficiency
- Run daily Cloud Scheduler job at 1 AM CDT to fetch previous day's data

**Schema** (`crypto_data.historical_prices`):
```
- timestamp: TIMESTAMP (partition key)
- symbol: STRING
- open: FLOAT64
- high: FLOAT64
- low: FLOAT64
- close: FLOAT64
- volume: FLOAT64
- data_source: STRING
- created_at: TIMESTAMP
```

### 2. LSTM Model Architecture

**Decision**: 2-layer LSTM with 50 units each, dropout 0.2

**Rationale**:
- Sufficient complexity for time series patterns without overfitting
- 7-day input window balances recent trends vs. noise
- Dropout prevents overfitting on crypto's volatile data

**Training Strategy**:
- Rolling window: Use days 1-7 to predict day 8's return
- Features: Raw OHLCV + MA(7,14,30) + RSI + volume momentum
- Train/val split: 80/20 with temporal ordering preserved
- Retrain weekly to adapt to market regime changes

**Model Versioning**:
- Save to Cloud Storage: `gs://bucket/models/{symbol}/model_{timestamp}.h5`
- Track metadata in BigQuery: training date, data range, validation RMSE
- Keep last 4 versions per symbol for rollback capability

### 3. Portfolio Rebalancing Logic

**Decision**: ML-enhanced equal-weight with risk constraints

**Base Strategy**:
- Start with equal allocation (25% each for 4 coins)
- Adjust weights based on ML predicted returns
- Higher predicted return → increase allocation (up to 40%)
- Lower/negative predicted return → decrease allocation (down to 10%)

**Risk Controls**:
- Max position size: 40% per cryptocurrency
- Min position size: 10% (maintain diversification)
- Min trade size: $50 (avoid excessive fee drag)
- Max single trade: $2,000 (reduce slippage risk)

**Rebalancing Frequency**:
- **When**: Every Sunday 10 PM CDT
- **Why**: Low trading volume = less slippage, pre-week positioning

**Fee Consideration**:
- Kraken fees: ~0.16% maker, ~0.26% taker
- Only rebalance if expected gain > 2% (covers fees + buffer)

### 4. Kraken API Integration

**Library**: `python-kraken-sdk` v2.3.0+

**Authentication**:
- API keys stored in Secret Manager
- Keys have permissions: Query, Trade (not Withdraw)
- Rotate keys every 90 days

**Rate Limits**:
- 15 requests per minute (API tier 2 assumed)
- Implement exponential backoff on 429 errors
- Queue orders if multiple symbols need rebalancing

**Order Types**:
- Use market orders for simplicity and guaranteed execution
- Future: Implement limit orders for lower fees

### 5. Streamlit Dashboard Design

**Page Structure**:
```python
# app.py main structure
def main():
    st.set_page_config(page_title="Crypto ML Dashboard", layout="wide")
    
    # Sidebar for navigation
    page = st.sidebar.selectbox("View", ["Portfolio", "Predictions", "Rebalancing"])
    
    if page == "Portfolio":
        show_portfolio_view()
    elif page == "Predictions":
        show_predictions_view()
    elif page == "Rebalancing":
        show_rebalancing_view()
```

**Caching Strategy**:
- Cache BigQuery queries for 5 minutes
- Cache model predictions for 1 day (update after weekly run)
- Cache portfolio data for 1 minute

**UI/UX Principles**:
- Mobile-responsive (single column on small screens)
- Dark mode support
- Real-time price updates with WebSocket (future)
- Export data as CSV for external analysis

### 6. Local Backtesting Engine

**Purpose**: Validate strategy on real Kraken historical data

**Backtest Results (90-day baseline)**:
- Period: July 2025 - October 2025
- Initial capital: $5,000
- Final value: $6,450.76
- **Total Return: +29.02%**
- **Sharpe Ratio: 3.35** ✅
- **Max Drawdown: 5.82%** ✅
- Total Trades: 23
- Rebalances: 13 (weekly)
- Fees: $19.25 (0.38%)

**Key Metrics**:
- Equal-weight baseline established
- All risk metrics exceeded targets
- Low volatility despite crypto market
- Realistic Kraken fees included (0.16% maker, 0.26% taker)

**Implementation** (`run_backtest.py`):
1. Fetch historical data from Kraken API
2. Simulate weekly rebalancing
3. Track portfolio value and trades
4. Calculate performance metrics
5. Establish baseline for ML to beat

### 7. Cloud Automation Workflow

**Weekly Rebalancing Cloud Function**:
```
Sunday 10 PM CDT → Cloud Scheduler triggers Cloud Function

Cloud Function steps:
1. Fetch latest data from BigQuery
2. Load trained models from Cloud Storage
3. Generate predictions for each symbol
4. Calculate target portfolio weights
5. Determine buy/sell orders
6. Execute trades via Kraken API (if confidence > threshold)
7. Log trades to BigQuery
8. Send notification email/Slack
```

**Notification Content**:
- Executed trades summary
- New portfolio allocation
- Model confidence scores
- Week-over-week performance

## 🔧 Technical Decisions Log

### Python Version: 3.9+
- **Why**: TensorFlow 2.x requires 3.9+, GCP Cloud Run supports it

### Streamlit vs. Flask/React
- **Chosen**: Streamlit
- **Why**: Rapid prototyping, built-in data viz, Python-native (no JS needed)
- **Trade-off**: Less customizable UI, but sufficient for MVP

### BigQuery vs. PostgreSQL
- **Chosen**: BigQuery
- **Why**: Serverless, scales automatically, integrates with GCP ecosystem
- **Trade-off**: More expensive for small datasets, but free tier covers MVP usage

### TensorFlow vs. PyTorch
- **Chosen**: TensorFlow/Keras
- **Why**: Better integration with Vertex AI, simpler API for LSTMs
- **Trade-off**: PyTorch more flexible for research, but not needed here

### Custom Backtesting vs. QuantConnect
- **Chosen**: Custom Python engine
- **Why**: Full control, integrates with our stack, uses real Kraken data, free
- **Trade-off**: Less features than pro platform, but we built exactly what we need
- **Benefit**: Production-ready code, no external dependencies

### Market Orders vs. Limit Orders
- **Chosen**: Market orders (for now)
- **Why**: Guaranteed execution, simpler implementation
- **Trade-off**: Higher fees, but acceptable for weekly rebalancing
- **Future**: Add limit orders to reduce costs

## 🎓 Lessons Learned

### Phase 1 & Portfolio Integration:

**Technical Learnings:**
1. **Kraken API Authentication**: HMAC-SHA512 signature generation is tricky but well documented
2. **Staking Assets**: Kraken uses suffixes (.B, .F, .S) to indicate bonded/futures positions
3. **Streamlit Caching**: `@st.cache_data` is crucial for performance with API calls
4. **Asset Mapping**: Need to handle Kraken's naming (XXBT vs XBT vs BT.B all = BTC)

**UI/UX Learnings:**
1. **Large KPIs Work Better**: Users prefer big, colorful cards over small metrics
2. **Separation is Clarity**: Showing liquid vs staked separately reduces confusion
3. **Manual Refresh**: Users want control over when data updates (vs auto-refresh)
4. **Progressive Disclosure**: Expandable sections for details (like "What is Staking?") work well

**Security Learnings:**
1. **Never Commit Secrets**: .gitignore is critical - always check before commits
2. **Read-Only First**: Start with query-only API permissions, add trading later
3. **API Key Rotation**: Plan to rotate keys every 90 days for security

**Development Learnings:**
1. **Test with Real Data Early**: Mock data hides real-world edge cases
2. **Debug Views Help**: Adding expandable debug sections helped troubleshooting
3. **Incremental Features**: Building in small steps made debugging easier

## 📞 Questions to Resolve

- [ ] Should we use daily or hourly data for training? (Daily chosen for now)
- [ ] What confidence threshold for auto-executing trades? (TBD after backtesting)
- [ ] Should we implement stop-losses? (Phase 2 consideration)
