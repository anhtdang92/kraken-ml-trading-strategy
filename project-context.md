### Cloud Architecture (GCP)

- **Cloud Run**: Hosts Streamlit application (containerized)
- **Vertex AI**: Trains LSTM models on schedule
- **BigQuery**: Stores historical data, trading logs, model metrics
- **Cloud Storage**: Stores trained models and backups
- **Cloud Scheduler**: Triggers weekly rebalancing function
- **Cloud Functions**: Executes automated trading logic
- **Secret Manager**: Securely stores Kraken API credentials

## 🎯 Core Features & Design Decisions

### 1. Data Collection Strategy

**Decision**: Use Kraken API as primary data source, CoinAPI as backup

**Rationale**:
- Kraken API is free and provides OHLCV data
- Direct integration with trading platform ensures data consistency
- CoinAPI can fill historical gaps if needed

**Implementation**:
- Fetch daily OHLCV data for 4-12 cryptocurrencies
- Store in BigQuery partitioned by date for cost efficiency
- Run daily Cloud Scheduler job at 1 AM CDT to fetch previous day's data

**Schema** (`crypto_data.historical_prices`):
```
- timestamp: TIMESTAMP (partition key)
- symbol: STRING
- open: FLOAT64
- high: FLOAT64
- low: FLOAT64
- close: FLOAT64
- volume: FLOAT64
- data_source: STRING
- created_at: TIMESTAMP
```

### 2. LSTM Model Architecture

**Decision**: 2-layer LSTM with 50 units each, dropout 0.2

**Rationale**:
- Sufficient complexity for time series patterns without overfitting
- 7-day input window balances recent trends vs. noise
- Dropout prevents overfitting on crypto's volatile data

**Training Strategy**:
- Rolling window: Use days 1-7 to predict day 8's return
- Features: Raw OHLCV + MA(7,14,30) + RSI + volume momentum
- Train/val split: 80/20 with temporal ordering preserved
- Retrain weekly to adapt to market regime changes

**Model Versioning**:
- Save to Cloud Storage: `gs://bucket/models/{symbol}/model_{timestamp}.h5`
- Track metadata in BigQuery: training date, data range, validation RMSE
- Keep last 4 versions per symbol for rollback capability

### 3. Portfolio Rebalancing Logic

**Decision**: ML-enhanced equal-weight with risk constraints

**Base Strategy**:
- Start with equal allocation (25% each for 4 coins)
- Adjust weights based on ML predicted returns
- Higher predicted return → increase allocation (up to 40%)
- Lower/negative predicted return → decrease allocation (down to 10%)

**Risk Controls**:
- Max position size: 40% per cryptocurrency
- Min position size: 10% (maintain diversification)
- Min trade size: $50 (avoid excessive fee drag)
- Max single trade: $2,000 (reduce slippage risk)

**Rebalancing Frequency**:
- **When**: Every Sunday 10 PM CDT
- **Why**: Low trading volume = less slippage, pre-week positioning

**Fee Consideration**:
- Kraken fees: ~0.16% maker, ~0.26% taker
- Only rebalance if expected gain > 2% (covers fees + buffer)

### 4. Kraken API Integration

**Library**: `python-kraken-sdk` v2.3.0+

**Authentication**:
- API keys stored in Secret Manager
- Keys have permissions: Query, Trade (not Withdraw)
- Rotate keys every 90 days

**Rate Limits**:
- 15 requests per minute (API tier 2 assumed)
- Implement exponential backoff on 429 errors
- Queue orders if multiple symbols need rebalancing

**Order Types**:
- Use market orders for simplicity and guaranteed execution
- Future: Implement limit orders for lower fees

### 5. Streamlit Dashboard Design

**Page Structure**:
```python
# app.py main structure
def main():
    st.set_page_config(page_title="Crypto ML Dashboard", layout="wide")
    
    # Sidebar for navigation
    page = st.sidebar.selectbox("View", ["Portfolio", "Predictions", "Rebalancing"])
    
    if page == "Portfolio":
        show_portfolio_view()
    elif page == "Predictions":
        show_predictions_view()
    elif page == "Rebalancing":
        show_rebalancing_view()
```

**Caching Strategy**:
- Cache BigQuery queries for 5 minutes
- Cache model predictions for 1 day (update after weekly run)
- Cache portfolio data for 1 minute

**UI/UX Principles**:
- Mobile-responsive (single column on small screens)
- Dark mode support
- Real-time price updates with WebSocket (future)
- Export data as CSV for external analysis

### 6. QuantConnect Backtesting

**Purpose**: Validate strategy on historical data before live deployment

**Backtest Configuration**:
- Time period: January 2022 - Present (~3 years)
- Initial capital: $5,000
- Brokerage: `KrakenBrokerageModel`
- Benchmark: Equal-weight buy-and-hold

**Key Metrics to Track**:
- Total Return
- Sharpe Ratio (target: >1.5)
- Max Drawdown (target: <30%)
- Win Rate
- Profit Factor
- Trade frequency

**Algorithm Logic** (`backtest_strategy.py`):
1. Load historical ML predictions (pre-generated)
2. Rebalance weekly based on predictions
3. Log all trades to local CSV
4. Compare against buy-and-hold baseline

### 7. Cloud Automation Workflow

**Weekly Rebalancing Cloud Function**:
```
Sunday 10 PM CDT → Cloud Scheduler triggers Cloud Function

Cloud Function steps:
1. Fetch latest data from BigQuery
2. Load trained models from Cloud Storage
3. Generate predictions for each symbol
4. Calculate target portfolio weights
5. Determine buy/sell orders
6. Execute trades via Kraken API (if confidence > threshold)
7. Log trades to BigQuery
8. Send notification email/Slack
```

**Notification Content**:
- Executed trades summary
- New portfolio allocation
- Model confidence scores
- Week-over-week performance

## 🔧 Technical Decisions Log

### Python Version: 3.9+
- **Why**: TensorFlow 2.x requires 3.9+, GCP Cloud Run supports it

### Streamlit vs. Flask/React
- **Chosen**: Streamlit
- **Why**: Rapid prototyping, built-in data viz, Python-native (no JS needed)
- **Trade-off**: Less customizable UI, but sufficient for MVP

### BigQuery vs. PostgreSQL
- **Chosen**: BigQuery
- **Why**: Serverless, scales automatically, integrates with GCP ecosystem
- **Trade-off**: More expensive for small datasets, but free tier covers MVP usage

### TensorFlow vs. PyTorch
- **Chosen**: TensorFlow/Keras
- **Why**: Better integration with Vertex AI, simpler API for LSTMs
- **Trade-off**: PyTorch more flexible for research, but not needed here

### Market Orders vs. Limit Orders
- **Chosen**: Market orders (for now)
- **Why**: Guaranteed execution, simpler implementation
- **Trade-off**: Higher fees, but acceptable for weekly rebalancing
- **Future**: Add limit orders to reduce costs
